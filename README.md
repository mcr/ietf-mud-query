# MUD and IoT device inventories mechanisms

This document describes a mechanism to do an inventory of devices on a network.

While there are significant abuse and privacy concerns with kind of scanning, the practice of scanning networks and fingerprinting devices has been occuring since the mid 1990s.
But, the adhoc methods are not reliable and do not provide any kind of strong device identity.

This document takes the approach that if it will happen, it might as well be reliable and secure.
It leverages MUD (RFC8520) and IDevID certificates.

It is a candidate document for the IOTOPS WG
